# Exercise 6: Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and rate).
#
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0
# Exercise 7: Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string.
#
#  Score   Grade
# >= 0.9     A
# >= 0.8     B
# >= 0.7     C
# >= 0.6     D
#  < 0.6     F
# Enter score: 0.95
# A
# Enter score: perfect
# Bad score
# Enter score: 10.0
# Bad score
# Enter score: 0.75
# C
# Enter score: 0.5
# F
# Run the program repeatedly to test the various different values for input.
